# bootstrap-portfolio

## Description

This portfolio was made using the Bootstrap technology - more specifically Bootstrap version 4.3.1.

The challenge of this design lied in applying the custom styling to my already, uniquely, designed page. As such, I had to rely on CSS to apply specific borders, padding, margins and colors in certain areas of the page.

The layout was mostly done and heavy-lifted by Bootstrap, so I did not have to create any flexbox/grid from scratch.

Below is the design screenshot, showcasing the **original** portfolio that I have built from scratch.
